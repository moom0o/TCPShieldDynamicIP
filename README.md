# TCPShieldDynamicIP
A plugin to add to your minecraft server if you have a dynamic IP!

Made for some server owner friends

**Currently spigot-paper only because waterfall is being a piece of shit and not working in intellij.**

## DESIGNED FOR 1.12.2!
Don't come crying if it doesn't work on newer versions! (It should.)
